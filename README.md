Pitch: Community Platform for Environmental and Social Betterment  

Description: Petrichor is an independent volunteering Non-Governmental Organization established by a small group of university students committed to providing a platform to build a community for environmental and social contributions for the welfare of society. Here we work with our community by providing them a platform to tackle deforestation by planting trees, improve the lives of needy children by educating them for their betterment and contributing towards any social help using a hands-on, grassroots approach to bring positive changes by their enthusiasm. We appreciate our contributors and encourage them to connect with other contributors or help them to make a bigger contribution to the betterment of society. Through this platform, we hope to get more and more passionate persons who thrive to contribute to the environment and help others by their kind hearts.  

Please check and join us for a social cause!
